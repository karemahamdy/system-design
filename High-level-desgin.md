# High-Level Design
High-level design or HLD refers to the overall system, a design that consists description of the system architecture and design and is a generic system design that includes:
- System architecture
- Database design
- Brief description of systems, services, platforms, and relationships among modules.

`Scope of High-Level Design Document:` The High-Level Design documentation presents the structure of the system as the application/database architecture, application flow, and technology architecture.

# Components of High-Level Design
1- Attributes and features of software entities.  
2- Relationships between different software entities (components, modules, classes, etc)

# Purpose of High-Level Design
The purpose of this High-Level Design (HLD) is to add the necessary detailed description to represent a suitable model. This is designed to help with operational requirements and can be used as a reference manual for how the modules interact. 

#  How To Design Scalable High-level Design (HLD) Systems
`This passage provides an overview of various concepts in system design, focusing on scalability, efficiency, and robustness:`

- `Capacity Estimation:` 
  
  Predicting the necessary resources like processing power, memory, and bandwidth to ensure the system can handle its workload without bottlenecks.

- `HTTP and HTTPS Methods:`
  
   Describes common methods like GET, PUT, and POST used for communication between clients and servers.

- `WebSockets:` 
 
  Enables real-time, two-way communication between a client and a server without waiting for responses, used in applications like gaming and chat.

- `Polling:`

  A technique where a client continuously requests updates from the server at regular intervals.

- `Server-Sent Events (SSE):`

  One-way communication where the server sends updates to the client, commonly used for real-time data streaming.

- `Filtering: In APIs`
  
   filtering allows retrieval of specific data by applying conditions like sorting and pagination to manage large datasets.

- `Rate Limiting:` 
 
  Controls the number of requests a system can process in a specific time to avoid overloading.

- `Resiliency:`

  Ensuring a system can recover from faults through methods like replication, redundancy, and availability.

- `Paging:` 
   
   Handling large datasets by breaking them into manageable chunks and filtering specific data based on requirements.

- `Logging:` 
  
   Keeping records of events for tracking, debugging, and monitoring system health, crucial in distributed systems.
