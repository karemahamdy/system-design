# What is Requirements Gathering?
Requirements Gathering is the process of understanding and documenting what is needed for a project or system. It involves collecting key details to ensure the project meets the stakeholders' needs. The main goals of requirements gathering are:

`Identify Stakeholders`
- Determine who the key stakeholders are, such as clients, users, and developers, who will be impacted by or involved in the project.

`Understand Business Needs`
- Clearly define what the business or client is trying to achieve. This includes identifying business problems, goals, and how the system will provide value.

`Capture Functional Requirements`
- Functional requirements specify what the system should do. This includes:
- Features
- Interactions
- Behaviors
`Document Non-Functional Requirements`
- These define how the system should perform. Examples include:

- Performance
- Security
- Usability
- Scalability
- Prioritize Requirements
## Determine which requirements are critical and must be implemented first, versus those that are lower priority or can be phased in later.

`Validate and Verify`
Ensure that the gathered requirements align with stakeholder expectations and that the proposed system will meet these needs.

`Create Formal Documentation`
Produce documents such as a requirements specification or use case scenarios, which provide a reference for developers and stakeholders.
